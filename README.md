ML Basic Challenges and Solutions

The actual challenges can be found at the link here : https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/tree/master/challenges.

These solutions are not unique solutions. There can be more than one solution. The solutions uploaded here are what I believe as appropriate methods at the current time and to demonstrate my current capabilities. These solutions and my capabilities are subject to change over time, with technological and logical improvements. 

The models that I generated are also saved in the repository.
